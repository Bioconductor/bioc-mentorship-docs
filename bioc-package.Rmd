# Making a Bioconductor package {#bioc-package}

This chapter demonstrates the making of a Bioconductor package using a workflow
that includes the CRAN package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("usethis")` and the
Bioconductor package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("biocthis")`.

This is just one example of an opinionated workflow for making a
Bioconductor-friendly package, highlighting accessory packages
with the goal of helping automate the process of creating R packages for
Bioconductor or making them Bioconductor-friendly.

It is not a requirement to follow this workflow when preparing a package for
submission to the Bioconductor repository.
Many package developers learn from the experience of developing their first
packages and develop their own personal preferences and templates,
when working on their subsequent packages.

Throughout this chapter, this example is used to illustrate essential and
recommended components for Bioconductor packages, to give readers knowledge
and information allowing them to develop Bioconductor packages indepedently
of this workflow, if they so wish.

## Environment

This workflow was written on the operating system macOS Big Sur.
Other operating systems may require some adjustments.

This workflow uses
[RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

This workflow was written using R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01) -- "Bird Hippie".

This workflow starts in the RStudio application, outside of any RStudio project.

## Install accessory packages

First, we install the CRAN package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("remotes")`, if it is
not installed yet.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("remotes")
}
```

Next, we immediately used the newly installed package to install a number of
CRAN packages that will be used to develop the new Bioconductor package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_cran(
    c(
        "available",
        "BiocManager",
        "biocthis",
        "devtools",
        "knitr",
        "pkgdown",
        "RefManageR",
        "rmarkdown",
        "rstudioapi",
        "sessioninfo",
        "styler",
        "usethis"
    )
)
```

Next, we install the Bioconductor package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("BiocStyle")`,
if it is not installed yet.
That package will be used for styling the vignettes of the new Bioconductor
package and linking to other packages.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocStyle", quietly = TRUE)) {
    BiocManager::install("BiocStyle")
}
```

## Check if the package name is available on CRAN and Bioconductor

Packages submitted to the Bioconductor repository must have a name that is
not currently used on neither CRAN nor Bioconductor.
Furthermore, it is a good idea to check whether the package name exists
as a GitHub repository, in case another package with that name is being 
developed and/or submitted.

We use the newly installed CRAN package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("available")`
to check whether the name that we want to give to the new package is already
in use in either Bioconductor or CRAN, or has a meaning that we might not be
aware of.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
available::available("MyBioconductorPackage")
```

If prompted whether to report potentially offensive results in the
Urban Dictionary, type `Y` or `N` depending on your preference, and press the
Return key.

Note that the function `available::available()` displays some information in
the R console of the RStudio application, while simultaneously opening a number
of tabs in our default web browser.

The information in the R console indicates whether the package name
is syntactically valid and not in use yet on CRAN, Bioconductor, or GitHub.
If you opted for the Urban Dictionary, the console also reports the meaning
and sentiment analysis for words and acronym that the name of the package,
as well as sub-strings and acronym that the name of the package contains

Each tab in your default web browser reports the result of a search
on Wikipedia, Wiktionary, and other websites, for the name of the package,
sub-strings, and acronyms.
It is up to you to check the contents of those pages and decide whether you
wish to continue the process with that package name.

## Create a package template with `usethis`

When we are satisfied with the name of your package, we use the function
`usethis::create_package()` to create a package template.
In this example, we first change directory to `~/Desktop`, to create 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("~/Desktop")
usethis::create_package("MyBioconductorPackage")
```

The R console displays some information as the package template is created.
In this example, we saw:

```
✔ Creating 'MyBioconductorPackage/'
✔ Setting active project to '/Users/kevin/Desktop/MyBioconductorPackage'
✔ Creating 'R/'
✔ Writing 'DESCRIPTION'
Package: MyBioconductorPackage
Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case)
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R (parsed):
    * First Last <first.last@example.com> [aut, cre] (YOUR-ORCID-ID)
Description: What the package does (one paragraph).
License: `use_mit_license()`, `use_gpl3_license()` or friends to
    pick a license
Encoding: UTF-8
Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)
RoxygenNote: 7.1.2
✔ Writing 'NAMESPACE'
✔ Writing 'MyBioconductorPackage.Rproj'
✔ Adding '^MyBioconductorPackage\\.Rproj$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Adding '.Rproj.user' to '.gitignore'
✔ Adding '^\\.Rproj\\.user$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Opening '/Users/kevin/Desktop/MyBioconductorPackage/' in new RStudio session
✔ Setting active project to '<no active project>'
```

The RStudio application then reloads and opens the RStudio project on the new
package in a new RStudio application window.

![Initial state of the RStudio project for the new package.](images/rstudio-package-initial-state.png){width=100%}

The package template provided by the CRAN package
`r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("usethis")` includes some of the essential files that make
an R package.
Alphabetically:

- The optional file `.gitignore` is used to declare file names and patterns that
  will be ignored by git version control.
- The optional file `.Rbuildignore` is used to declare file names that will be
  ignored when the package is built.
- The essential file `DESCRIPTION` declares information about the package,
  its authors, licensing, and additional information relevant for package
  development and documentation.
- The optional file `MyBioconductorPackage.Rproj` is used by the RStudio
  application to store project settings.
- The essential file `NAMESPACE` is used to declare functions imported from
  other packages (i.e., dependencies) and functions exported by the new package.
- The essential directory `R/` - initially empty - is used to store R scripts
  that contain the code of the new package.

## Create template scripts using `biocthis`

At this point, we use the Bioconductor package
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("biocthis")` to generate some R scripts with the goal of
helping automate the process of creating R packages for Bioconductor or making
them Bioconductor-friendly.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
biocthis::use_bioc_pkg_templates()
```

The R console display information are a sub-directory `dev/` and several R
scripts are created.

```
✔ Setting active project to '/Users/kevin/Desktop/MyBioconductorPackage'
✔ Creating 'dev/'
✔ Adding '^dev$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Writing 'dev/01_create_pkg.R'
• Modify 'dev/01_create_pkg.R'
✔ Writing 'dev/02_git_github_setup.R'
• Modify 'dev/02_git_github_setup.R'
✔ Writing 'dev/03_core_files.R'
• Modify 'dev/03_core_files.R'
✔ Writing 'dev/04_update.R'
• Modify 'dev/04_update.R'
```

In the next sections, we will go through those R scripts in turn.

## Create the R package

Open the file `dev/01_create_pkg.R`.

Carefully read the contents of the file, including comments and code, as we have
run most of that code already in the previous steps.

In this example, we have already run all the code in that script, so we can
directly open the file `dev/02_git_github_setup.R`.
We can click on the tab of the file already open in the Source panel of the
RStudio application, or we can run the last line of code in the script
`dev/01_create_pkg.R`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rstudioapi::navigateToFile(usethis::proj_path("dev", "02_git_github_setup.R"))
```

## Exclude files from git version control

In this example, the first step in the script `02_git_github_setup.R` is
to add a line in the file `.gitignore`, declaring that any file ending with the
extension `.Rproj` should be ignored from git version control.
We also add a nother line declaring that the sub-directory `dev/` should also
be ignored.

Packages submitted to the Bioconductor repository should not contain files with
the `Rproj` extension, as those files are only useful on the computer of package
developers using the RStudio application.
Those files have no use on the Bioconductor repository.

The sub-directory `dev/` also does not belong on the Bioconductor repository.
The only purpose of R scripts in that sub-directory is to set up a template for
the new package on the computer of the package developer.
When the template is set up, those scripts and the sub-directory can all be
safely removed.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_git_ignore("*.Rproj")
usethis::use_git_ignore("dev/")
```

If you wish to visualise the change, you can open the file `.gitignore`.
You will see that the last two lines of the file now declare `*.Rproj` and
`dev/`.

## Set up git

Next, the script gives us the command to set up git version control for the new
package.

Version control is fundamental to durable software development.
It allows package developers to track incremental changes made to the package,
revert mistakes, and collaborate with other developers working simultaneously
on the same package.

A git repository can be initialised on the command line in a Unix terminal.
However, the CRAN package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("usethis")` provides a function
to automate this process from the R console.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_git()
```

In this example, we are prompted whether we wish to commit some of the files
that were created. We choose the option to consent, and press the Return key
to confirm.

```
There are 4 uncommitted files:
* '.gitignore'
* '.Rbuildignore'
* 'DESCRIPTION'
* 'NAMESPACE'
Is it ok to commit them?

1: Yeah
2: No way
3: Not now

Selection: 1
✔ Adding files
✔ Making a commit with message 'Initial commit'
```

When prompted to restart the RStudio application, we choose the option to
consent and press the Return key confirm.

```
• A restart of RStudio is required to activate the Git pane
Restart now?

1: Absolutely not
2: No way
3: Yup

Selection: 3
```

Once the RStudio application has restarted, we can see the Git tab in the
version control panel, and a `.git` sub-directory in the `Files` pane.

![View of the RStudio application after activating git version control.](images/rstudio-git-tab.png){width=100%}

Note:

- The `.git` sub-directory may not be visible until you enable the option to
`Show Hidden Files`.

![Show hidden files.](images/rstudio-show-hidden-files.png)

## Connect the git repository to GitHub

The [GitHub](https://github.com/) website provides a platform to build, ship,
and maintain software, free of charge for public repositories.

A GitHub repository can be created interactively on the
[GitHub](https://github.com/) website.
However, the CRAN package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("usethis")` provides
functionality to automate this process from the R console.

Part of the process adds a couple of lines in the file `DESCRIPTION`,
declaring URLs for the landing page of the repository, and the web page where
issues can be reported.
When prompted whether we wish to commit the changes, we choose the option to
consent, and press the Return key to confirm.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_github()
```

```
✔ Creating GitHub repository 'kevinrue/MyBioconductorPackage'
✔ Setting remote 'origin' to 'git@github.com:kevinrue/MyBioconductorPackage.git'
✔ Setting URL field in DESCRIPTION to 'https://github.com/kevinrue/MyBioconductorPackage'
✔ Setting BugReports field in DESCRIPTION to 'https://github.com/kevinrue/MyBioconductorPackage/issues'
There is 1 uncommitted file:
* 'DESCRIPTION'
Is it ok to commit it?

1: Absolutely not
2: Not now
3: Yup

Selection: 3
✔ Adding files
✔ Making a commit with message 'Add GitHub links to DESCRIPTION'
✔ Pushing 'main' branch to GitHub and setting 'origin/main' as upstream branch
✔ Opening URL 'https://github.com/kevinrue/MyBioconductorPackage'
```

Note:

- If this is your first time running `use_github()`, the script provides you
  some additional commands that you may need to run before the command above
  can be run successfully. However, that level of detail is beyond the scope of
  this chapter.

Once the command completes,it automatically opens the landing page of the new
GitHub repository in our default web browser.

![Landing page of the GitHub repository.](images/github-landing-page-initial.png){width=100%}

## Edit the DESCRIPTION file

Open the file `dev/03_core_files.R` and follow the instructions.

The first comment in the script recommends to edit the file `DESCRIPTION`.
Great sources of information for best practices on that subject are:

- <http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html>
- <http://contributions.bioconductor.org/description.html>

First, the field `Package` already contains the name that we have chosen for our
package.
If you decide to change the package name from this point onward, you should be
mindful of all the other places where you will need to also update that name.

Next, the field `Title` is the first field that we want to update from the
default placeholder.
Note that this field expects a single line in
[title case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case),
where all words are capitalized except for minor words.
In this example, we go with `Demonstration of a Bioconductor Package`.
In doubt, you can always look at some of your favourite packages for
inspiration.

Next, the field `Version` must be changed to either version `0.99.0` or any
version number that is [semantically](https://semver.org/) lower than that.
This is because `0.99.0` is the version number that is expected in package
submitted to the Bioconductor repository, and version numbering should never
go backward.
In this example, we set the version to `0.99.0`, as we do not expect to change
that version number ever in the future.
You might want to pick a lower version number, if you wish to
increment version numbers during your work on the package before your first
submission to the Bioconductor project (e.g., `0.1.0` -> `0.2.0` -> `0.2.1`).

Next, the field `Authors@R` must also be changed from the default placeholder
to provide information about the package developer(s) and maintainer.
The default template is designed for a single-person project, calling directly
the function `person()`.
For projects that involve multiple contributors, or to make it future-proof
in case contributors join the project at a later date, the field can concatenate
as many calls to the function `person()` as needed within a call to the function
`c()`.
In this example, we add the information about the author of this chapter,
within a call to the function `c()`.

```
Authors@R: 
    c(person("Kevin", "Rue", "Christophe", "kevinrue@users.noreply.github.com",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),
             comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0003-3899-3872")))
```

Next, the field `Description` must also be changed to provide a longer
description of the package, albeit general guidelines recommend to keep the
length of that field to a single paragraph.
For instance, in this case we can say:

```
Description: This package demonstrates the set up of a Bioconductor-friendly
    package using the packages usethis and biocthis. The setup includes the
    initialisation of a git repository as well as the connection of the local
    repository to the GitHub website.
```

Note that this field can always be updated at a later date, to refine the
description of the package (or fix typos).

Next, the field `License` declares the licensing choice made by the copyright
holder of the package.
Bioconductor packages are typically licensed under `Artistic-2.0`, although
a number of other choices are commonly accepted for community-contributed
packages.
In this example, we choose the MIT license, which incidentally can be easily
set up using the CRAN package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("usethis")`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_mit_license()
```

The R console display information as files are edited.
In this example, the field `License` is automatically updated in the file
`DESCRIPTION`, while files `LICENSE` and `LICENSE.md` are created,
and the file `.Rbuildignore` is also updated to ignore the non-standard file
`LICENSE.md` when the package is built.

```
✔ Setting License field in DESCRIPTION to 'MIT + file LICENSE'
✔ Writing 'LICENSE'
✔ Writing 'LICENSE.md'
✔ Adding '^LICENSE\\.md$' to '.Rbuildignore'
```
