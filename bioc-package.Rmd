# Making a Bioconductor package {#bioc-package}

This chapter demonstrates the making of a Bioconductor package using a workflow
that includes the CRAN package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("usethis")` and the
Bioconductor package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("biocthis")`.

This is just one example of an opinionated workflow for making a
Bioconductor-friendly package, highlighting accessory packages
with the goal of helping automate the process of creating R packages for
Bioconductor or making them Bioconductor-friendly.

It is not a requirement to follow this workflow when preparing a package for
submission to the Bioconductor repository.
Many package developers learn from the experience of developing their first
packages and develop their own personal preferences and templates,
when working on their subsequent packages.

Throughout this chapter, this example is used to illustrate essential and
recommended components for Bioconductor packages, to give readers knowledge
and information allowing them to develop Bioconductor packages indepedently
of this workflow, if they so wish.

## Environment

This workflow was written on the operating system macOS Big Sur.
Other operating systems may require some adjustments.

This workflow uses
[RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

This workflow was written using R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01) -- "Bird Hippie".

This workflow starts in the RStudio application, outside of any RStudio project.

## Install accessory packages

First, we install the CRAN package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("remotes")`, if it is
not installed yet.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("remotes")
}
```

Next, we immediately used the newly installed package to install a number of
CRAN packages that will be used to develop the new Bioconductor package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_cran(
    c(
        "available",
        "BiocManager",
        "biocthis",
        "devtools",
        "knitr",
        "pkgdown",
        "RefManageR",
        "rmarkdown",
        "rstudioapi",
        "sessioninfo",
        "styler",
        "usethis"
    )
)
```

Next, we install the Bioconductor package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("BiocStyle")`,
if it is not installed yet.
That package will be used for styling the vignettes of the new Bioconductor
package and linking to other packages.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocStyle", quietly = TRUE)) {
    BiocManager::install("BiocStyle")
}
```

## Check if the package name is available on CRAN and Bioconductor

Packages submitted to the Bioconductor repository must have a name that is
not currently used on neither CRAN nor Bioconductor.
Furthermore, it is a good idea to check whether the package name exists
as a GitHub repository, in case another package with that name is being 
developed and/or submitted.

We use the newly installed CRAN package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("available")`
to check whether the name that we want to give to the new package is already
in use in either Bioconductor or CRAN, or has a meaning that we might not be
aware of.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
available::available("MyBioconductorPackage")
```

If prompted whether to report potentially offensive results in the
Urban Dictionary, type `Y` or `N` depending on your preference, and press the
Return key.

Note that the function `available::available()` displays some information in
the R console of the RStudio application, while simultaneously opening a number
of tabs in our default web browser.

The information in the R console indicates whether the package name
is syntactically valid and not in use yet on CRAN, Bioconductor, or GitHub.
If you opted for the Urban Dictionary, the console also reports the meaning
and sentiment analysis for words and acronym that the name of the package,
as well as sub-strings and acronym that the name of the package contains

Each tab in your default web browser reports the result of a search
on Wikipedia, Wiktionary, and other websites, for the name of the package,
sub-strings, and acronyms.
It is up to you to check the contents of those pages and decide whether you
wish to continue the process with that package name.

## Create a package template

When we are satisfied with the name of your package, we use the function
`usethis::create_package()` to create a package template.
In this example, we first change directory to `~/Desktop`, to create 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("~/Desktop")
usethis::create_package("MyBioconductorPackage")
```

The R console displays some information as the package template is created.
In this example, we saw:

```
✔ Creating 'MyBioconductorPackage/'
✔ Setting active project to '/Users/kevin/Desktop/MyBioconductorPackage'
✔ Creating 'R/'
✔ Writing 'DESCRIPTION'
Package: MyBioconductorPackage
Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case)
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R (parsed):
    * First Last <first.last@example.com> [aut, cre] (YOUR-ORCID-ID)
Description: What the package does (one paragraph).
License: `use_mit_license()`, `use_gpl3_license()` or friends to
    pick a license
Encoding: UTF-8
Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)
RoxygenNote: 7.1.2
✔ Writing 'NAMESPACE'
✔ Writing 'MyBioconductorPackage.Rproj'
✔ Adding '^MyBioconductorPackage\\.Rproj$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Adding '.Rproj.user' to '.gitignore'
✔ Adding '^\\.Rproj\\.user$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Opening '/Users/kevin/Desktop/MyBioconductorPackage/' in new RStudio session
✔ Setting active project to '<no active project>'
```

The RStudio application then reloads and opens the RStudio project on the new
package in a new RStudio application window.

![Initial state of the RStudio project for the new package.](images/rstudio-package-initial-state.png){width=100%}

The package template provided by the CRAN package
`r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("usethis")` includes some of the essential files that make
an R package.
Alphabetically:

- The optional file `.gitignore` is used to declare file names and patterns that
  will be ignored by git version control.
- The optional file `.Rbuildignore` is used to declare file names that will be
  ignored when the package is built.
- The essential file `DESCRIPTION` declares information about the package,
  its authors, licensing, and additional information relevant for package
  development and documentation.
- The optional file `MyBioconductorPackage.Rproj` is used by the RStudio
  application to store project settings.
- The essential file `NAMESPACE` is used to declare functions imported from
  other packages (i.e., dependencies) and functions exported by the new package.
- The essential directory `R/` - initially empty - is used to store R scripts
  that contain the code of the new package.

## New RStudio project

In the top right corner of the RStudio application, click on `New Project...`.

![RStudio - New Project...](images/new-rstudio-project.png){width=66%}

In the `New Project Wizard`, select the option `New Directory`.

![RStudio - New Project Wizard - Create Project](images/wizard-create-project.png){width=66%}

Then, click on `New Project`.

![RStudio - New Project Wizard - Project type](images/wizard-project-type.png){width=66%}

Then, type the name of your package in the field `Directory Name`,
this will also be used as the name of a new directory in which your package
will be stored.
Select a parent directory on your computer where that new directory will be
created.

In this example, we allow the RStudio application to initialise a
[git](TODO) repository and a [renv](TODO) environment.

It is recommended to initialise a git repository as early as possible in the
lifecycle of the package, to facilitate version control.

The `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("renv")` package is a great option to manage
the environment in which the package is developped, independently from any other
RStudio project on your computer.

When you are ready, click the button `Create Project`.

![RStudio - New Project Wizard - Create New Project](images/wizard-create-new-project.png){width=66%}

The RStudio application should display the newly created project as follows.

![Initial state of a new RStudio project.](images/rstudio-project-initial.png){width=100%}

Notes:

- In the example above, the file `.gitignore` was created becaused we opted
  to `Create a git repository`.
- Similarly, the files and directories `.Rprofile`, `renv/`, and `renv.lock`
  were created becaused we opted to `Use renv with this project`.

## Exclude initial files from version control

In this example, we opted to let the RStudio application initialise a git
repository for us in the newly created project directory.

Files that have been created, modified, or deleted are listed in the Git panel
of the RStudio application.

![Initial state of the RStudio Git panel](images/git-initial.png){width=66%}

In this example, all the files initially created are only relevant to the
local development of the package, and should be excluded from version control.

Select all the files, click on the wheel, and click on `Ignore...`.

![Exclude the initial files from version control](images/git-ignore-initial.png){width=66%}


In the modal window that opens, check that all the files to ignore were added.
The RStudio application may not automatically add the file `.gitignore`,
in which case you can type it manually yourself on a new line.
It is recommended to add an empty line at the end of the file.

When you are ready, click the button `Save`.

![Manually add the file .gitignore to the .gitignore file.](images/git-ignore-gitignore.png){width=66%}

The Git panel of the RStudio application should be empty now.

## Install BiocManager and biocthis

In this example, we use the package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("renv")` to create
and manage the environment in which the package is developed, independently
from any other RStudio project on the same computer.

However, a consequence of this is that the newly created environment does not
contain any R package other than the base R packages.

First, install the CRAN package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("BiocManager")`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("BiocManager")
```

Then, install the Bioconductor package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("biocthis")`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install("biocthis")
```

If prompted whether you "want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)", type `Yes` and press the Return key.

## Create a package template

Call the function `biocthis::use_bioc_pkg_templates()` from the R console panel
in the RStudio application.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
biocthis::use_bioc_pkg_templates()
```

The function creates a sub-directory `dev/` and a number of R scripts that are
designed to help us create our new Bioconductor-friendly package.
The RStudio application will automatically open the newly created scripts in the
Source panel.

In the next sections, we will go through those scripts.

## Create the R package

Open the script  `dev/01_create_pkg.R` and follow instructions therein.

<!-- See "Install accessory packages" -->

In this example, an empty sub-directory with the name of the name of the package
was created.
This sub-directory is a supefluous artifact of the process, which should be
removed.
Click on the checkbox next to the sub-directory, click the `Delete` button,
and click the `Yes` button in the modal to confirm.

![Delete the empty directory.](images/files-package-delete.png)

## First commit

The Git panel of the RStudio application should now list a number of files
created by the CRAN package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("usethis")` in the previous
step.
Those files - `.Rbuildignore`, `DESCRIPTION`, and `NAMESPACE` - are the first
files of the new Bioconductor package.
They must be commited to the git repository.

Tick the checkbox next to the files - ignore the directory `dev/` created
earlier by the Bioconductor package `BiocStyle::Biocpkg("biocthis")` - and click
the button `Diff`.

![Commit the files generated by `usethis::create_package()`](images/git-commit-usethis.png)

Add a commit message and click the button `Commit`.

![Write a commit message.](images/git-commit-usethis-message.png)

## Deprecated

### usethis

The function `usethis::create_package()` can be used to initialise the skeleton of an R package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::create_package("~/Desktop/NewBiocPackage")
```

That command will initialise the skeleton of an R package in the requested directory.
The name of the package will be set to the name of the new directory, in this case `NewBiocPackage`.

```

✓ Setting active project to '<no active project>'
```

### biocthis

The `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('biocthis')` package provide convenient utilities to automate package and project setup for Bioconductor packages.

- [`biocthis::use_bioc_pkg_templates()`](https://lcolladotor.github.io/biocthis/reference/use_bioc_pkg_templates.html) creates four `dev/*.R` scripts that guide you in the process of setting up an RStudio project for a Bioconductor-friendly R package.
