# Making a Bioconductor package {#bioc-package}

This chapter demonstrates the making of a Bioconductor package using the
Bioconductor package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("biocthis")`.

This is just one example of an opinionated workflow for making a
Bioconductor-friendly package, highlighting a community effort
with the goal of helping automate the process of creating R packages for
Bioconductor or making them Bioconductor-friendly.

It is not a requirement to follow this workflow when preparing a package for
submission to the Bioconductor repository.
Many package developers learn from their earlier experience and develop
their own personal preferences and templates, when working on their subsequent
packages.

Throughout this chapter, this example is used to illustrate essential and
recommended components for Bioconductor packages, to give readers knowledge
and information allowing them to develop Bioconductor packages indepedently
of this workflow, if they so wish.

## Pre-requisites

This workflow was written on the operating system macOS Big Sur.
Other operating systems may require some adjustments.

This workflow uses [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

This workflow was written using R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01) -- "Bird Hippie".

## New RStudio project

In the top right corner of the RStudio application, click on `New Project...`.

![RStudio - New Project...](images/new-rstudio-project.png){width=66%}

In the `New Project Wizard`, select the option `New Directory`.

![RStudio - New Project Wizard - Create Project](images/wizard-create-project.png){width=66%}

Then, click on `New Project`.

![RStudio - New Project Wizard - Project type](images/wizard-project-type.png){width=66%}

Then, type the name of your package in the field `Directory Name`,
this will also be used as the name of a new directory in which your package
will be stored.
Select a parent directory on your computer where that new directory will be
created.

In this example, we allow the RStudio application to initialise a
[git](TODO) repository and a [renv](TODO) environment.

It is recommended to initialise a git repository as early as possible in the
lifecycle of the package, to facilitate version control.

The `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("renv")` package is a great option to manage
the environment in which the package is developped, independently from any other
RStudio project on your computer.

When you are ready, click the button `Create Project`.

![RStudio - New Project Wizard - Create New Project](images/wizard-create-new-project.png){width=66%}

The RStudio application should display the newly created project as follows.

![Initial state of a new RStudio project.](images/rstudio-project-initial.png){width=100%}

Notes:

- In the example above, the file `.gitignore` was created becaused we opted
  to `Create a git repository`.
- Similarly, the files and directories `.Rprofile`, `renv/`, and `renv.lock`
  were created becaused we opted to `Use renv with this project`.

## Exclude initial files from version control

In this example, we opted to let the RStudio application initialise a git
repository for us in the newly created project directory.

Files that have been created, modified, or deleted are listed in the Git panel
of the RStudio application.

![Initial state of the RStudio Git panel](images/git-initial.png){width=66%}

In this example, all the files initially created are only relevant to the
local development of the package, and should be excluded from version control.

Select all the files, click on the wheel, and click on `Ignore...`.

![Exclude the initial files from version control](images/git-ignore-initial.png){width=66%}


In the modal window that opens, check that all the files to ignore were added.
The RStudio application may not automatically add the file `.gitignore`,
in which case you can type it manually yourself on a new line.
It is recommended to add an empty line at the end of the file.

When you are ready, click the button `Save`.

![Manually add the file .gitignore to the .gitignore file.](images/git-ignore-gitignore.png){width=66%}

The Git panel of the RStudio application should be empty now.

## Install BiocManager and biocthis

In this example, we use the package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("renv")` to create
and manage the environment of t

## Deprecated

### usethis

The function `usethis::create_package()` can be used to initialise the skeleton of an R package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::create_package("~/Desktop/NewBiocPackage")
```

That command will initialise the skeleton of an R package in the requested directory.
The name of the package will be set to the name of the new directory, in this case `NewBiocPackage`.

### biocthis

The `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('biocthis')` package provide convenient utilities to automate package and project setup for Bioconductor packages.

- [`biocthis::use_bioc_pkg_templates()`](https://lcolladotor.github.io/biocthis/reference/use_bioc_pkg_templates.html) creates four `dev/*.R` scripts that guide you in the process of setting up an RStudio project for a Bioconductor-friendly R package.
