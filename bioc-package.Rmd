# Making a Bioconductor package {#bioc-package}

This chapter demonstrates the making of a Bioconductor package using a workflow
that includes the CRAN package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("usethis")` and the
Bioconductor package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("biocthis")`.

This is just one example of an opinionated workflow for making a
Bioconductor-friendly package, highlighting accessory packages
with the goal of helping automate the process of creating R packages for
Bioconductor or making them Bioconductor-friendly.

It is not a requirement to follow this workflow when preparing a package for
submission to the Bioconductor repository.
Many package developers learn from the experience of developing their first
packages and develop their own personal preferences and templates,
when working on their subsequent packages.

Throughout this chapter, this example is used to illustrate essential and
recommended components for Bioconductor packages, to give readers knowledge
and information allowing them to develop Bioconductor packages indepedently
of this workflow, if they so wish.

## Environment

This workflow was written on the operating system macOS Big Sur.
Other operating systems may require some adjustments.

This workflow uses
[RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

This workflow was written using R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01) -- "Bird Hippie".

This workflow starts in the RStudio application, outside of any RStudio project.

## Install accessory packages

First, we install the CRAN package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("remotes")`, if it is
not installed yet.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("remotes")
}
```

Next, we immediately used the newly installed package to install a number of
CRAN packages that will be used to develop the new Bioconductor package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_cran(
    c(
        "available",
        "BiocManager",
        "biocthis",
        "devtools",
        "knitr",
        "pkgdown",
        "RefManageR",
        "rmarkdown",
        "rstudioapi",
        "sessioninfo",
        "styler",
        "usethis"
    )
)
```

Next, we install the Bioconductor package `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("BiocStyle")`,
if it is not installed yet.
That package will be used for styling the vignettes of the new Bioconductor
package and linking to other packages.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocStyle", quietly = TRUE)) {
    BiocManager::install("BiocStyle")
}
```

## Check if the package name is available on CRAN and Bioconductor

Packages submitted to the Bioconductor repository must have a name that is
not currently used on neither CRAN nor Bioconductor.
Furthermore, it is a good idea to check whether the package name exists
as a GitHub repository, in case another package with that name is being 
developed and/or submitted.

We use the newly installed CRAN package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("available")`
to check whether the name that we want to give to the new package is already
in use in either Bioconductor or CRAN, or has a meaning that we might not be
aware of.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
available::available("MyBioconductorPackage")
```

If prompted whether to report potentially offensive results in the
Urban Dictionary, type `Y` or `N` depending on your preference, and press the
Return key.

Note that the function `available::available()` displays some information in
the R console of the RStudio application, while simultaneously opening a number
of tabs in our default web browser.

The information in the R console indicates whether the package name
is syntactically valid and not in use yet on CRAN, Bioconductor, or GitHub.
If you opted for the Urban Dictionary, the console also reports the meaning
and sentiment analysis for words and acronym that the name of the package,
as well as sub-strings and acronym that the name of the package contains

Each tab in your default web browser reports the result of a search
on Wikipedia, Wiktionary, and other websites, for the name of the package,
sub-strings, and acronyms.
It is up to you to check the contents of those pages and decide whether you
wish to continue the process with that package name.

## Create a package template with `usethis`

When we are satisfied with the name of your package, we use the function
`usethis::create_package()` to create a package template.
In this example, we first change directory to `~/Desktop`, to initialise the
directory that contains the new package on the `Desktop`.
Instead, you will likely prefer to initialise your package in your own preferred
directory on your computer.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("~/Desktop")
usethis::create_package("MyBioconductorPackage")
```

The R console displays some information as the package template is created.
In this example, we saw:

```
✔ Creating 'MyBioconductorPackage/'
✔ Setting active project to '/Users/kevin/Desktop/MyBioconductorPackage'
✔ Creating 'R/'
✔ Writing 'DESCRIPTION'
Package: MyBioconductorPackage
Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case)
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R (parsed):
    * First Last <first.last@example.com> [aut, cre] (YOUR-ORCID-ID)
Description: What the package does (one paragraph).
License: `use_mit_license()`, `use_gpl3_license()` or friends to
    pick a license
Encoding: UTF-8
Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)
RoxygenNote: 7.1.2
✔ Writing 'NAMESPACE'
✔ Writing 'MyBioconductorPackage.Rproj'
✔ Adding '^MyBioconductorPackage\\.Rproj$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Adding '.Rproj.user' to '.gitignore'
✔ Adding '^\\.Rproj\\.user$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Opening '/Users/kevin/Desktop/MyBioconductorPackage/' in new RStudio session
✔ Setting active project to '<no active project>'
```

The RStudio application then reloads and opens the RStudio project on the new
package in a new RStudio application window.

![Initial state of the RStudio project for the new package.](images/rstudio-package-initial-state.png){width=100%}

The package template provided by the CRAN package
`r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("usethis")` includes some of the essential files that make
an R package.
Alphabetically:

- The optional file `.gitignore` is used to declare file names and patterns that
  will be ignored by git version control.
- The optional file `.Rbuildignore` is used to declare file names that will be
  ignored when the package is built.
- The essential file `DESCRIPTION` declares information about the package,
  its authors, licensing, and additional information relevant for package
  development and documentation.
- The optional file `MyBioconductorPackage.Rproj` is used by the RStudio
  application to store project settings.
- The essential file `NAMESPACE` is used to declare functions imported from
  other packages (i.e., dependencies) and functions exported by the new package.
- The essential directory `R/` - initially empty - is used to store R scripts
  that contain the code of the new package.

## Create template scripts using `biocthis`

At this point, we use the Bioconductor package
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("biocthis")` to generate some R scripts with the goal of
helping automate the process of creating R packages for Bioconductor or making
them Bioconductor-friendly.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
biocthis::use_bioc_pkg_templates()
```

The R console display information are a sub-directory `dev/` and several R
scripts are created.

```
✔ Setting active project to '/Users/kevin/Desktop/MyBioconductorPackage'
✔ Creating 'dev/'
✔ Adding '^dev$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Writing 'dev/01_create_pkg.R'
• Modify 'dev/01_create_pkg.R'
✔ Writing 'dev/02_git_github_setup.R'
• Modify 'dev/02_git_github_setup.R'
✔ Writing 'dev/03_core_files.R'
• Modify 'dev/03_core_files.R'
✔ Writing 'dev/04_update.R'
• Modify 'dev/04_update.R'
```

In the next sections, we will go through those R scripts in turn.

## Create the R package

Open the file `dev/01_create_pkg.R`.

Carefully read the contents of the file, including comments and code, as we have
run most of that code already in the previous steps.

In this example, we have already run all the code in that script, so we can
directly open the file `dev/02_git_github_setup.R`.
We can click on the tab of the file already open in the Source panel of the
RStudio application, or we can run the last line of code in the script
`dev/01_create_pkg.R`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rstudioapi::navigateToFile(usethis::proj_path("dev", "02_git_github_setup.R"))
```

## Exclude files from git version control

In this example, the first step in the script `02_git_github_setup.R` is
to add a line in the file `.gitignore`, declaring that any file ending with the
extension `.Rproj` should be ignored from git version control.
We also add a nother line declaring that the sub-directory `dev/` should also
be ignored.

Packages submitted to the Bioconductor repository should not contain files with
the `Rproj` extension, as those files are only useful on the computer of package
developers using the RStudio application.
Those files have no use on the Bioconductor repository.

The sub-directory `dev/` also does not belong on the Bioconductor repository.
The only purpose of R scripts in that sub-directory is to set up a template for
the new package on the computer of the package developer.
When the template is set up, those scripts and the sub-directory can all be
safely removed.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_git_ignore("*.Rproj")
usethis::use_git_ignore("dev/")
```

If you wish to visualise the change, you can open the file `.gitignore`.
You will see that the last two lines of the file now declare `*.Rproj` and
`dev/`.

## Set up git

Next, the script gives us the command to set up git version control for the new
package.

Version control is fundamental to durable software development.
It allows package developers to track incremental changes made to the package,
revert mistakes, and collaborate with other developers working simultaneously
on the same package.

A git repository can be initialised on the command line in a Unix terminal.
However, the CRAN package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("usethis")` provides a function
to automate this process from the R console.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_git()
```

In this example, we are prompted whether we wish to commit some of the files
that were created. We choose the option to consent, and press the Return key
to confirm.

```
There are 4 uncommitted files:
* '.gitignore'
* '.Rbuildignore'
* 'DESCRIPTION'
* 'NAMESPACE'
Is it ok to commit them?

1: Yeah
2: No way
3: Not now

Selection: 1
✔ Adding files
✔ Making a commit with message 'Initial commit'
```

When prompted to restart the RStudio application, we choose the option to
consent and press the Return key confirm.

```
• A restart of RStudio is required to activate the Git pane
Restart now?

1: Absolutely not
2: No way
3: Yup

Selection: 3
```

Once the RStudio application has restarted, we can see the Git tab in the
version control panel, and a `.git` sub-directory in the `Files` pane.

![View of the RStudio application after activating git version control.](images/rstudio-git-tab.png){width=100%}

Note:

- The `.git` sub-directory may not be visible until you enable the option to
`Show Hidden Files`.

![Show hidden files.](images/rstudio-show-hidden-files.png)

## Connect the git repository to GitHub

The [GitHub](https://github.com/) website provides a platform to build, ship,
and maintain software, free of charge for public repositories.

A GitHub repository can be created interactively on the
[GitHub](https://github.com/) website.
However, the CRAN package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("usethis")` provides
functionality to automate this process from the R console.

Part of the process adds a couple of lines in the file `DESCRIPTION`,
declaring URLs for the landing page of the repository, and the web page where
issues can be reported.
When prompted whether we wish to commit the changes, we choose the option to
consent, and press the Return key to confirm.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_github()
```

```
✔ Creating GitHub repository 'kevinrue/MyBioconductorPackage'
✔ Setting remote 'origin' to 'git@github.com:kevinrue/MyBioconductorPackage.git'
✔ Setting URL field in DESCRIPTION to 'https://github.com/kevinrue/MyBioconductorPackage'
✔ Setting BugReports field in DESCRIPTION to 'https://github.com/kevinrue/MyBioconductorPackage/issues'
There is 1 uncommitted file:
* 'DESCRIPTION'
Is it ok to commit it?

1: Absolutely not
2: Not now
3: Yup

Selection: 3
✔ Adding files
✔ Making a commit with message 'Add GitHub links to DESCRIPTION'
✔ Pushing 'main' branch to GitHub and setting 'origin/main' as upstream branch
✔ Opening URL 'https://github.com/kevinrue/MyBioconductorPackage'
```

Note:

- If this is your first time running `use_github()`, the script provides you
  some additional commands that you may need to run before the command above
  can be run successfully. However, that level of detail is beyond the scope of
  this chapter.

Once the command completes,it automatically opens the landing page of the new
GitHub repository in our default web browser.

![Landing page of the GitHub repository.](images/github-landing-page-initial.png){width=100%}

## Edit the DESCRIPTION file

Open the file `dev/03_core_files.R` and follow the instructions.

The first comment in the script recommends to edit the file `DESCRIPTION`.
Great sources of information for best practices on that subject are:

- <http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html>
- <http://contributions.bioconductor.org/description.html>

Before we start editing any of the fields, we use the function `biocthis::use_bioc_description()` to add two more fields.

First, Bioconductor requires an additional field named `biocViews`.
The field must be populated by terms selected from a controlled vocabulary,
to facilitate the thematic classification of the new package on the Bioconductor
website.
The full list of available biocViews can be navigated
[here](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html).

Separately, an optional field named `Date` can also be added to the file
`DESCRIPTION`. If available, that field is used for generating the package
citation information.

Both fields are added and automaticall filled bu the function
`biocthis::use_bioc_description()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
biocthis::use_bioc_description()
```

When prompted whether to over-write the pre-existing file `DESCRIPTION`, we
choose the answer to consent and press the Return key.
The console then displays the contents of the updated file `DESCRIPTION`.

```
✔ Setting active project to '/Users/kevin/Desktop/MyBioconductorPackage'
Overwrite pre-existing file 'DESCRIPTION'?

1: Negative
2: No
3: Definitely

Selection: 3
✔ Writing 'DESCRIPTION'
Package: MyBioconductorPackage
Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case)
Version: 0.99.0
Date: 2022-05-10
Authors@R (parsed):
    * First Last <first.last@example.com> [aut, cre] (YOUR-ORCID-ID)
Description: What the package does (one paragraph).
License: Artistic-2.0
URL: https://github.com/kevinrue/MyBioconductorPackage
BugReports:
    https://support.bioconductor.org/t/MyBioconductorPackage
biocViews: Software
Encoding: UTF-8
Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)
RoxygenNote: 7.1.2
```

Now we open the file `DESCRIPTION` and carefully examine each field.

First, the field `Package` already contains the name that we have chosen for our
new package.

```
Package: MyBioconductorPackage
```

Note:

- If you decide to change the package name from this point onward, you should be
  mindful of all the other places where you will need to also update that name.

Next, the field `Title` is the first field that we want to update from the
default placeholder.
Note that this field expects a single line in
[title case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case),
where all words are capitalized except for minor words.
In this example, we go with `Demonstration of a Bioconductor Package`.
In doubt, you can always look at some of your favourite packages for
inspiration.

```
Title: Demonstration of a Bioconductor Package
```

Next, the field `Version` must be set to either version `0.99.0` or any
version number that is [semantically](https://semver.org/) lower than that.
This is because `0.99.0` is the version number that is expected in package
submitted to the Bioconductor repository, and version numbering should never
go backward.
In this example, we leave the version `0.99.0` that was automatically set by the
function `biocthis::use_bioc_description()`, as we do not expect to change
that version number ever in the future.
You might want to pick a lower version number, if you wish to
increment version numbers during your work on the package before your first
submission to the Bioconductor project (e.g., `0.1.0` -> `0.2.0` -> `0.2.1`).

```
Version: 0.99.0
```

Next, we leave the field `Date` to the date of today, that was automatically
filled by the function `biocthis::use_bioc_description()`.

```
Date: 2022-05-10
```

Next, the field `Authors@R` must also be changed from the default placeholder
to provide information about the package developer(s) and maintainer.
The default template is designed for a single-person project, calling directly
the function `person()`.
For projects that involve multiple contributors, or to make it future-proof
in case contributors join the project at a later date, the field can concatenate
as many calls to the function `person()` as needed within a call to the function
`c()`.
In this example, we add the information about the author of this chapter,
within a call to the function `c()`.

```
Authors@R: 
    c(person("Kevin", "Rue", "Christophe", "kevinrue@users.noreply.github.com",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),
             comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0003-3899-3872")))
```

Next, the field `Description` must also be changed to provide a longer
description of the package, albeit general guidelines recommend to keep the
length of that field to a single paragraph.
For instance, in this case we choose to write:

```
Description: This package demonstrates the set up of a Bioconductor-friendly
    package using the packages usethis and biocthis. The setup includes the
    initialisation of a git repository as well as the connection of the local
    repository to the GitHub website.
```

Note:

- Best practices encourage us to wrap the contents of the field over multiple
  lines, in a way that each line of the file `DESCRIPTION` does not exceed 80
  characters, and each line from the second one is indented by four spaces.

Next, the field `License` declares the licensing choice made by the copyright
holder of the package.
Bioconductor packages are typically licensed under `Artistic-2.0`, although
a number of other choices are commonly accepted for community-contributed
packages.
In this example, we leave the `Artistic-2.0` license automatically set by the
function `biocthis::use_bioc_description()`.

```
License: Artistic-2.0
```

The next two fields of the file are `URL` and `BugReports`,
which were recently added by the function `usethis::use_github()` and 
subsequently edited by the function `biocthis::use_bioc_description()`.

```
URL: https://github.com/kevinrue/MyBioconductorPackage
BugReports: https://support.bioconductor.org/t/MyBioconductorPackage
```

Although this demonstration package may never be actually included in the
Bioconductor repository, we decide to leave the `BugReports` field to a URL
directing to the [Bioconductor support site](https://support.bioconductor.org),
as it is a great source of information from fellow package users and developers.

Next, we can leave the Bioconductor-specific field `biocViews` to the value
`Software` automatically filled by the function
`biocthis::use_bioc_description()`, at least until we add some code to the
package and determine other terms that best describe our new package.

```
biocViews: Software
```

Next, the field `Encoding` can usually be left at the default value.
In this example, this is `UTF-8`.

```
Encoding: UTF-8
```

Finally, the fields `Roxygen` and `RoxygenNote` can usually be left to their
default value.
In this example, those were `list(markdown = TRUE)` and `7.1.2`, respectively.
The former is a list of options passed to the CRAN package
`r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("roxygen2")` -- used to generate manual pages -- while
the latter tracks the version of `BiocStyle::CRANpkg("roxygen2")` that was last
used to manage the documentation in this particular Bioconductor package.

With that, we have finished out first round of edits to the file `DESCRIPTION`.
Importantly, we have highlighted many of the fields in this file that are prone
to regular updates as the package continues to be developed:

- the `Version` field can be updated to create new releases of the package.
- the `Date` field should be updated in parallel with the `Version` field,
  to mark the release date of each version of the package.
- the `Authors@R` field can be edited to update information about existing
  or new contributors to the package.
- the `Description` field can be updated to refine information about the
  package, for instance as new functionality is added.
- the `BugReports` field can be updated when the package is acccepted in the
  Bioconductor repository.
- the `biocViews` field can be updated to refine the list of terms used to
  thematically classify the package in the Bioconductor repository.

## Create the README file

Most code repositories include a file named `README.md`, that often provides
useful information to new users, such as instructions to install the package,
a brief showcase of the package functionality, or preferences for citing the
package.

In this example, we use function `biocthis::use_bioc_readme_rmd()` to generate
a template R Markdown file named `README.Rmd`, that we will adapt to our own
new package before compiling it to a regular Markdown file `README.md`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
biocthis::use_bioc_readme_rmd()
```

```
✔ Writing 'README.Rmd'
✔ Adding '^README\\.Rmd$' to '.Rbuildignore'
• Modify 'README.Rmd'
✔ Writing '.git/hooks/pre-commit'
```

The R console displays some information as the file `README.Rmd` is created.
When the command completes, the file is automatically opened in the Source panel
of the RStudio application, where we can carefully read and edit it as needed.

We see that the initial template contains code that we can expect to fail at
this point in time.

First, some of the instructions in the section `## Installation instructions`
clearly assume that our new package can be obtained and installed from the
Bioconductor repository.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("MyBioconductorPackage")
```

This is obviously not the case yet, and those instructions would cause an error
for anyone attempting to run that code.
While we could decide to remove those currently invalid instructions, it is
acceptable to keep them as a placeholder, as they indicate our intention to
submit that package to the Bioconductor repository, and those command will be 
valid when the package is accepted and included in the Bioconductor repository.

Similarly, the section `## Example` demonstrates how to load the package, as
well as running some code that is currently unrelated to our new package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("MyBioconductorPackage")
...
summary(cars)
...
plot(pressure)
```

Since our package does not contain any code yet, we do not have any code to
demonstrate the functionality of the package itself.
Again, it is acceptable to keep that part of the template as a placeholder and a
reminder that as our new package matures, we should use this section to briefly
demonstrate how to use the package.

Again, the rest of this template file describes aspects of the package that are
not in place yet.
In this example, we choose to keep this template file exactly as it was
generated, as there is nothing that needs urgent attention or editing.

Following the next set of instructions in the script `03_core_files.R`, we use
the function `devtools::build_readme()` to compile the R Markdown file
`README.Rmd` into a Markdown file `README.md`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::build_readme()
```

```
ℹ Installing MyBioconductorPackage in temporary library
ℹ Building /Users/kevin/Desktop/MyBioconductorPackage/README.Rmd
Loading required namespace: MyBioconductorPackage
```

The console displays some information, as our package is temporarily installed for the duration of the command.

When the command completes successfully, we see the newly created file
`README.md`.
We can open that file, and see that it contains the regular Markdown contents
from the original `README.Rmd` source file, as well as the output of the code
chunks that were executed during compilation.

The takeaway from this section is that the file `README.md` is ultimately the
target file that we want to produce.
However, the `README.Rmd` is a convenient way to include example code that can
be automatically executed, with the results embedded directly into the file `README.md` without any additional work on our part.
All that we need to remember is to re-compile the file `README.md` every time
that we update the source file `README.Rmd`.

## Create the NEWS file

R packages should include a file named `NEWS` to keep track of changes to the
code from one version to the next.
A valid alternative is the the file `NEWS.md`.

In this example, we use the function `biocthis::use_bioc_news_md()` to create
a template file that we can examine and edit as needed.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
biocthis::use_bioc_news_md()
```

The R console displays some information as the file `NEWS.md` is created.
When the command completes, the file is automatically opened in the Source panel
of the RStudio application.

```
✔ Writing 'NEWS.md'
• Modify 'NEWS.md'
```

In this example, the file contains an entry that starts with a first level
heading that declares the package name and current version.

Next, the template contents includes three sections, each with a single bullet
point.

In this example, we keep only the first section that declares the creation of
the file `NEWS.md`.
We delete the next two sections, as their contents does not describe anything
relevant to our work so far.
The final contents of the file `NEWS.md` in this example are shown below.

```
# MyBioconductorPackage 0.99.0

NEW FEATURES

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
```

The takeaway from this section is that the file `NEWS.md` should be regularly
updated to briefly describe changes introduced in each new version of the
package.

New entries should be added at the top of the file, resulting in a reverse
chronological order.
There is no restriction on the name of sections within each entry.
For future reference, the sections used in the initial template were:

- `NEW FEATURES`
- `SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES`
- `BUG FIXES`

Those sections cover most of the situations, but you are free to use different
section titles that may better fit your needs.

## Create a Bioconductor-styled code of conduct

The Bioconductor project declares a code of conduct that community members are
expected to respect when participating in community events and communicating
on community platforms (e.g., support site, Slack workspace).

In this example, we use the function `biocthis::use_bioc_coc()` to generate
a template file indicating that our new package subscribes to that code of
conduct.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
biocthis::use_bioc_coc()
```

The R console displays information as files are created and edited.
In particular, when the command completes, our clipboard contains some text
that we can add to the file `README.Rmd`.

```
✔ Creating '.github/'
✔ Adding '^\\.github$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Adding '*.html' to '.github/.gitignore'
✔ Writing '.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md'
• Don't forget to describe the code of conduct in your README:
  ## Code of Conduct
  Please note that the MyBioconductorPackage project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](http://bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/). By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
  [Copied to clipboard]
```

In this example, we open the file `README.Rmd` and paste the contents of the
clipboard at the end of the file.
Importantly, we remember to re-compile this file `README.Rmd` to update the 
target file `README.md`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::build_readme()
```

From the information displayed in the R console, we also learn that a
sub-directory named `.github` was created, and a file named `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
was created within that new sub-directory.

We can take a moment to open that new file and examine its contents.

```
The Bioconductor community values

* an open approach to science that promotes the sharing of ideas, code, and expertise
* collaboration
* diversity and inclusivity
* a kind and welcoming environment

```

In this example, we decide to keep the contents of the template file as they
are.

## Create a guide for contributions

Optionally, R packages are welcome to include a file `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`.
That file is used to inform potential contributors to the package of our
preferences to receive and handle such contributions.

In this example, we use the function `usethis::use_tidy_contributing()` to set
up a template file that we can examine and edit as needed.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_tidy_contributing()
```

The R console displays information as the file `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` is
created.

```
✔ Writing '.github/CONTRIBUTING.md'
```

That template file is relatively long to display here, so we encourage you to
carefully inspect the one that is create when you run the command above, and
edit it as needed.
In this example, we keep the contents of the template file as they are.

## Create a guide for getting support

Another optional file that may be added to Bioconductor packages is
`.github/SUPPORT.md`.
That file is used to inform users of the package about sources of information
and help when they experience difficulties while using the package.

In this example, we use the function `biocthis::use_bioc_support()` to set
up a template file that we can examine and edit as needed.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
biocthis::use_bioc_support()
```

The R console displays information as the file `.github/SUPPORT.md` is
created.

```
✔ Writing '.github/SUPPORT.md'
```

That template file is relatively long to display here, so we encourage you to
carefully inspect the one that is create when you run the command above, and
edit it as needed.
In this example, we keep the contents of the template file as they are.

## Create a GitHub issue template

Bioconductor packages maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com)
benefit of a web page for reporting issues about the package, typically
identified by users or developers of packages that depend on the functionality
provided by this package.

By default, the form for reporting issue is entirely blank, leaving users to
decide what information they think is sufficient to describe their issue.
GitHub repositories have the possibility of including template forms designed to
guide users in identifying and reporting all the information relevant to their
issue.
Useful information often involves a minimal reproducible example, including
a small data set that is either publicly available or simulated by some code,
alongside the code that is either throwing an error, or producing an
unexpected output.

In this example, we use the function `biocthis::use_bioc_issue_template()`
to create a new sub-directory `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` and a template file
`issue_template.md` within that new sub-directory.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
biocthis::use_bioc_issue_template()
```

The R console displays some information as directories and files are created.
When the command completes, we can open the newly created file, to examine
and edit it as needed.

```
✔ Creating '.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/'
✔ Writing '.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/issue_template.md'
```

In this example, we decide to keep the original contents as they are.

## Create a CITATION template

Optionally, R packages can contain a file `inst/CITATION`, that provides
information encouraging and guiding users wishing to cite an article or book
related to the package.

In this example, we use the function `biocthis::use_bioc_citation()`
to create a new sub-directory `inst` and a template file `CITATION`
within that new sub-directory.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
biocthis::use_bioc_citation()
```

The R console displays some information as directories and files are created.
When the command completes, the file `inst/CITATION` is automatically opened
in the Source panel of the RStudio application where we can examine and edit
the contents of the file as needed.

```
✔ Creating 'inst/'
✔ Writing 'inst/CITATION'
• Modify 'inst/CITATION'
```

In this example, we edit the required argument `title=` of the two calls to the function `bibentry()` to `"Demonstration of a Bioconductor Package"` (which is
also the title of the package that we declared in the file `DESCRIPTION`).

At this point, we remember that the `README.Rmd` file demonstrates how to cite
the package.
As a consequence, we need to re-compile the file `README.Rmd` to update the file
`README.md`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::build_readme()
```

When the command completes, we can take the time to open the file `README.md`
and examine the new contents in the section `## Citation`.

## Add badges to the README file

Optionally, status badges can be added to the `README.Rmd` file, and displayed
in the `README.md` file. 

Lifecycle badges are popular to inform package users about the level of maturity
that they can expect from the package.
Packages in the earliest stages of developement -- as in our current
example -- tend to be updated frequently, as new experimental functionality is
regularly added, while bugs are being identified and fixed.
Conversely, package at later stages of development tend to be more stable,
allowing users to expect more reliability from the package functionality and a
relatively fixed set of best practices.

In this example, we use the function `usethis::use_lifecycle_badge()` to declare
that our new package is still at an early stage of development and should be
considered with care by our users.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_lifecycle_badge("Experimental")
```

The R console displays some information as the file `README.Rmd` is edited to
embed the new badge.

```
✔ Adding Lifecycle: experimental badge to 'README.Rmd'
• Re-knit 'README.Rmd'
```

As a consequence of the update to the file `README.Rmd`, we need to re-compile
that file to apply the changes to the file `README.md`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::build_readme()
```

When the command completes, we can take the time to open the file `README.md`
and examine the new line in the badges section.

```
<!-- badges: start -->
...
[![Lifecycle:
experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->
```

The next command in the script `03_core_files.R` demonstrates the function `usethis::use_github_actions_badge()`.

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is a optional
functionality of the GitHub website that makes it easy to automate workflows
related to software development, including regular building, testing, and
deployment of the code hosted in GitHub repositories.

In this example, we use the function `usethis::use_github_actions_badge()` to
add a badge that will display the result of a GitHub Actions workflow for our
new package.
We use the first argument `"R-CMD-check-bioc"` to declare the name of the
GitHub Actions workflow.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_github_actions_badge("R-CMD-check-bioc")
```

The R console displays some information as the file `README.Rmd` is edited to
embed the new badge.

```
✔ Setting active project to '/Users/kevin/Desktop/MyBioconductorPackage'
✔ Adding R-CMD-check-bioc badge to 'README.Rmd'
• Re-knit 'README.Rmd'
```

The last message reminds us to re-compile the file `README.Rmd` to apply the
update to the file `README.md`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::build_readme()
```

Note:

- At the moment, the GitHub Actions workflow itself is not defined.
  As a result, the badge may not display properly.
  This is entirely normal and acceptable, as the functionality of the package
  itself is in no way impacted by the contents of the file `README.md`.

## Enable unit tests

Separately from the code that create new functionality in a package,
unit tests allow package developers to write additional code that invokes
functions defined in the package, and verifies that they produce the expected
results in given scenarios.

In this example, we use the function `usethis::use_testthat()`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_testthat()
```

The R console displays some information as sub-directories and files are
created and edited.

```
✔ Adding 'testthat' to Suggests field in DESCRIPTION
✔ Setting Config/testthat/edition field in DESCRIPTION to '3'
✔ Creating 'tests/testthat/'
✔ Writing 'tests/testthat.R'
• Call `use_test()` to initialize a basic test file and open it for editing.
```

In this example, the file `DESCRIPTION` is edited to declare that our package
now depends on the CRAN package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("testthat")` for writing
and running tests, specifically version 3 of the testthat package.

```
Suggests: 
    testthat (>= 3.0.0)
Config/testthat/edition: 3
```

Simultaneously, a sub-directory `tests` and script file `tests/testthat.R` are
created.
That script is the entry point that is used to start the execution of any test
that we may write in the future.
At the moment, there is not test in the package.

Even though our package does not contain any code that we can test yet,
in this example, we use the function `usethis::use_test()` to demonstrate the
creation of a test script in the package.
We use the first argument `"example_test"` to declare the name of the
test file.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_test("example_test")
```

The R console displays some information as a sub-directory and a file are
created.

```
✔ Writing 'tests/testthat/test-example_test.R'
• Modify 'tests/testthat/test-example_test.R'
```

When the command completes, the new file `tests/testthat/test-example_test.R`
is open in the source panel of the RStudio application.
The script contains an example test that is designed to verify whether
R correctly returns the value 4 when asked to multiply 2 by 2.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
test_that("multiplication works", {
  expect_equal(2 * 2, 4)
})
```

This example is trivial and merely a placeholder that we will ultimately replace
by tests specifically tailored to verify that our own package functions behave
as expected.
For now, it is entirely acceptable to keep this example test, for the purpose
of setting up our package infrastructure.

Tied with the notion of tests is the notion of coverage.
Coverage is a metric in software testing that measures the fraction of source
code in a package that is traversed at least once during the execution the
entire series of tests in that package.

In this example, we use the function `usethis::use_coverage()` to set up files
and default settings for the execution and reporting of test coverage in our
package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_coverage()
```

In this example, the CRAN package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("covr")` is not
installed yet, so we are prompted to install it first.
We choose the option to consent.

```
ℹ The package `covr` is required.
✖ Would you like to install it?

1: Yes
2: No

Selection: 1
```

When packages are installed, the command will proceed to create and edit files,
displaying information in the R console as it does so.

```
✔ Adding 'covr' to Suggests field in DESCRIPTION
✔ Writing 'codecov.yml'
✔ Adding '^codecov\\.yml$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Adding Codecov test coverage badge to 'README.Rmd'
• Re-knit 'README.Rmd'
• Call `use_github_action("test-coverage")` to continuously monitor test coverage.
```

First, the CRAN package `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("covr")` is added to the
dependencies of our package in the file `DESCRIPTION`.
Then, a file `codecov.yml` is created with default options that control the
execution and reporting of the test coverage.
That new file is added to the file `.Rbuildignore`, to avoid warnings during
future builds of the package.
Another badge is added to the file `README.Rmd`, for reporting test coverage.

As a result of that last edit, we are reminded to re-compile the file
`README.Rmd`, to apply the updates to the file `README.md`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::build_readme()
```
