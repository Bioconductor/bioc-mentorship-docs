## Version 1.0.1 (2021-03-04)

### New features

* `bioc-package.Rmd`
  - Split into parallel workflows: "`rworkflows`" and "`usethis` + `biocthis`".
  - Removed section referencing `usethis::use_coverage()` 
  as this is no longer necessary due to changes to how    
  [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/) works.
  - Add subheaders to the *## Edit the DESCRIPTION file* section for easier navigation
  - Added sections on:
    - *Depends*
    - *Imports*
    - *Suggests*
    - *Remotes*
  - Rename section to make more generalisable: *Create a template GitHub Actions* --> *Enable GitHub Actions*
  - Rename section to make less ambiguous: *Using GitHub Actions* --> *Deploy GitHub Actions*
  
### Bug fixes

* Install `biochis` via `remotes::install_bioc()` 
  instead of `remotes::install_cran()` (which doesn't work).
* Fixed typos throughout.
* Fixed typo `vignette/`-->`vignettes/`
* Example GHA workflow report expired, so it's weird to reference it in tutorial:
  - https://github.com/kevinrue/MyBioconductorPackage/runs/6388422844?check_suite_focus=true
  - Instead, just include a link to the Actions tab.
  - Rather than saying "The full report is fairly large; only the `ERROR` message is displayed below."
    just collapse the full report by default.

## Version 1.0.0 (2021-07-27)

- Initial definition of the mentorship guidelines.
