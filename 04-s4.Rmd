# Bioconductor and S4 classes {#s4}

Bioconductor widely uses the S4 object system.

In particular, developers are strongly encouraged to re-use existing [Common Bioconductor Methods and Classes](https://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/commonMethodsAndClasses/) where possible.

The need for new classes may occasionally be identified (e.g., new technology or data type).
Often, new classes are derived from existing classes (i.e., inheriting slots from a parent class), while adding new functionality under the form of new slots and/or methods.
