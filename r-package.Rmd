# Making an R package {#r-package}

Bioconductor packages are first and foremost R packages.
Before considering guidelines specific to the Bioconductor project, developers should familiarize themselves with best practices for R packages generally.

The following resources form a trove of information for new and experienced package developers:

- The [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) book
- The [rOpenSci Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html) book

<!-- Curtis Kephart is the outreach officer for RStudio and has developed RStudio, basic R workshop. Might be worth a link (or contacting). -->
